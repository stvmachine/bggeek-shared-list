# Contributing

There are multiple ways to contribute with this project.

## Improve documentation

- `README.md`:
  - Needs more info about the current state of the project
  - Add instructions of how to start the project for new collaborators.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` is a good starting point but it needs more info about the roadmap and actionable ideas.

## Design improvement

Some of the components are being used as out-of-the-box from chakra-ui. Any, design improvement would be appreciated.
